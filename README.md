# Image-upload
This project demonstrates how to upload an image to a MySQL database using Android (Java, XML) and PHP. The Android app captures or selects an image, converts it to Base64, and sends it to a PHP script, which stores it in the database. The project includes both the Android client and PHP server-side code for handling image uploads.
